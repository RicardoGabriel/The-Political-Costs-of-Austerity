# The Political Costs of Austerity - Data

Folder [Data](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/The-Political-Costs-of-Austerity/tree/main/Data) has three subfolders:

	1. Eurostat - with information on the NUTS 2 areas.

	2. Algan - with information on the "Government Trust" variable that originally comes from Eurobarometer and is aggregated to the Nuts 2 level by Algan, Guriev, Papaioannou, and Passari (2017). If you use this information, please acknowledge this source.

	3. Out - with the final dataset used for the main analysis with all aggregated elections (Data_Final_nuts2) but also aggregated for the three different types of elections (European, National, and Regional). Data for 126 NUTS2 regions (8 countries) and 36 years (1980-2015). We include more information than the one used in the paper both about the elections and about the real variables according to the following descriptions:

	3.1 Out\Elections -  here we have only the election data. It is aggregated at the year-regional level which adds the number of votes in case there was more than one election in a given year (Data_Elections). But it can also be found disaggregated by type of election (European, National, and Regional). More information about the election types, assumptions, and data sources can be found in the paper's appendix.

	3.2 Out\Real - here we have all the real data. Data file "Data_IMFShocks" comes from the work by Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi (2019). Data_Real comes from our previous work Gabriel, Klein, and Pessoa (2023) that mostly collects data from ARDECO, Eurostat, Cambridge Econometrics, and OECD. Finally, Data_Analysis_Nuts0 aggregates some of this information to the National level. If you use this information, please acknowledge these sources.
